# tetris-fall-fun

A Tetris game application that provides a classic, engaging gameplay experience. The game should feature traditional Tetris mechanics, including rotating and positioning falling tetrominoes to complete lines and score points. The design should be simple yet visually appealing, with a clean interface that displays the upcoming piece, current score, and level. The game should allow for easy control of the tetrominoes, either through keyboard inputs or touch gestures for mobile compatibility. Implement a leveling system where the game speed increases as the player scores higher, making the game progressively more challenging. Additionally, include an option for players to pause and resume the game, and display high scores for added motivation.
